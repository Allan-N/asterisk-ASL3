<li>
<h4>safe_asterisk: Add ownership checks for /etc/asterisk/startup.d and its files.</h4>
  The safe_asterisk script now checks that, if it was run by the
  root user, the /etc/asterisk/startup.d directory and all the files it contains
  are owned by root.  If the checks fail, safe_asterisk will exit with an error
  and Asterisk will not be started.  Additionally, the default logging
  destination is now stderr instead of tty "9" which probably won't exist
  in modern systems.</li>
